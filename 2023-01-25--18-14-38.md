# Event-sourcing into working memory to improve data access latency

In this article, we describe a modernization, moving from a database-centric access pattern, towards event-sourcing data changes directly into the application's working memory (RAM). 

## Modernization scenario

The modernization started with a 'traditional' web application, which leverages both internal data, as well as calling into external APIs. In our scenario, the internal data represents configuration information necessary for the business logic in the app to handle the responses from the external APIs. An example could be an e-commerce site, which calls various external catalogues for goods, and applies business rules to the aggregated result. The internal configuration data in this scenario could e.g. be markup rules or the list of external APIs which can be called. When the business onboards a new catalogue provider, the admin team would update the internal configuration database with the new catalogue configuration. 

During request handling, the web app needs to query the internal configuration database to retrieve the current list of external dependencies such as catalogues, business rule configurations, etc.. The configuration information can change during normal operations, so the application developer has to work on a strategy to determine how often the underlying config database should be queried. 

Querying the configuration source on a per-request basis ensures to always work on the most recent configuration, but adds considerable load to the configuration database, increases the end-to-end latency of each request and therefore reduces the overall capacity of a web application node.
